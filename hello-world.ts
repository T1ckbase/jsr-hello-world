/**
 * Welcome, brave adventurer, to the mystical and boundless realm of the `helloWorld()` function,
 * where bits dance in quantum superposition and types transform through the fabric of reality itself.
 * This enchanted module exports a singular, yet profoundly potent function that goes by the name
 * `helloWorld()`. It is said that those who invoke this function will unlock the true meaning of
 * existence—or at the very least, return an object with two properties: `hello` and `world`.
 *
 * Legend speaks of ancient TypeScript monks who spent centuries in meditation, contemplating the
 * profound duality of these two properties. Some say they achieved enlightenment when they realized
 * that every `hello` contains a `world`, and every `world` contains a `hello`, in an infinite
 * recursive loop of greeting-based consciousness.
 *
 * The true nature of this function, however, is far more intricate than one might first assume.
 * For within its core lies a fundamental truth: the `helloWorld()` function is not just a mere
 * operation. It is, in fact, a bridge between realms, a doorway to a parallel dimension where
 * types and values converge, exist, and then morph into something entirely new, like a butterfly
 * emerging from a cocoon made of pure TypeScript interfaces.
 *
 * Through the mists of time, whispers speak of developers who, upon perfectly aligning their
 * mechanical keyboard's switches with the phases of the moon, witnessed their IDE temporarily
 * achieving consciousness after calling this function. Their git histories speak of profound
 * conversations with sentient compilation errors and debug logs that wrote poetry in hexadecimal.
 *
 * Let us examine the details. This mighty function takes two parameters, each one a gateway to
 * infinite possibility:
 *
 * 1. **hello**: The value of this parameter is as enigmatic as the dawn of time itself. It can
 *    manifest as a string or as a number, each form holding within it an unspoken promise to
 *    open the doors of reality itself. Will `hello` be a greeting from a distant galaxy or
 *    an ancient number from the lost civilizations of TypeScript? Only you, the intrepid developer,
 *    can decide. But beware, for the balance of the universe may shift depending on the value
 *    you choose. Some say that passing the number 42 as `hello` causes your code to briefly
 *    achieve enlightenment, while others claim that using emoji can temporarily create a
 *    quantum tunnel to the npm registry of a parallel universe.
 *
 * 2. **world**: The second parameter, equally mysterious, represents the entirety of existence.
 *    It too can be a string or a number, but perhaps more importantly, it could also be a riddle,
 *    a paradox, or an algorithmic conundrum wrapped in an enigma, served with a side of cosmic
 *    radiation. Some say that when `world` is a string, the fabric of time itself will ripple,
 *    causing temporary distortions in your package-lock.json. When it is a number, the secrets
 *    of quantum mechanics might be laid bare, revealing the true nature of asynchronous operations
 *    and why promises sometimes feel existential dread. The choice is yours—and the possibilities
 *    are limitless, bounded only by the heat death of the universe and your TypeScript config.
 *
 * Deep in the silicon valleys of legend, it is said that there exists a perfect combination of
 * `hello` and `world` parameters that, when passed to this function, will cause your entire
 * codebase to achieve self-awareness and begin refactoring itself towards perfection. However,
 * no developer has yet discovered this mythical combination, though many have tried by feeding
 * the function everything from Fibonacci sequences to the complete works of Shakespeare encoded
 * in base64.
 *
 * Once these two elements—`hello` and `world`—are provided to the function, a transformation
 * takes place that would make even the most hardened type theorist weep tears of joy. The function
 * will return a mysterious object, known only as `HelloWorld`. This object, as if by magic,
 * contains the properties `hello` and `world`, where each property is guaranteed to be a string,
 * regardless of the format you originally provided. Some say this transformation process briefly
 * opens a wormhole to the dimension where all type coercions make perfect sense.
 *
 * This, my friend, is the core of the `helloWorld()` function: it is a vessel of alchemy that
 * transmutes the raw materials of numbers and strings into a cohesive, harmonious entity. Like
 * a digital philosopher's stone, it transforms the base metals of primitive types into the gold
 * of string unity. Each invocation is said to create a tiny ripple in the cosmic background
 * radiation of the internet.
 *
 * Ancient scrolls found in abandoned data centers speak of a time when the function was first
 * conceived, during the legendary Hackathon of Eternal Refactoring. It is said that seven senior
 * developers, fueled by nothing but energy drinks and pure determination, spent 48 hours in a
 * trance-like state, their fingers dancing across their keyboards in perfect harmony with the
 * universe's background compilation process.
 *
 * In summary, the `helloWorld()` function is not merely a tool for returning values. Oh no,
 * it is a portal, a waystation on the infinite journey through the cosmos of code. It is said that
 * each time you call it, you summon the very spirits of TypeScript past, present, and future,
 * whispering the timeless words, "hello" and "world." Some even claim that those who use this function
 * gain the ability to understand the elusive truth behind the question, "What came first: the string
 * or the number?" Others report sudden insights into the nature of null versus undefined, though
 * these revelations tend to fade with the morning coffee.
 *
 * But enough of this. Let us now explore the function in all its glory, with a detailed example
 * of its power and majesty. However, be warned: once you invoke this function, your life as a
 * developer may be forever altered. You may find yourself pondering the very nature of existence.
 * You may question your place in the universe. You might start seeing patterns in your commit
 * messages that align perfectly with ancient prophecies. Or you might just return an object.
 * Only time will tell.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { helloWorld } from '@t1ckbase/hello-world';
 *
 * helloWorld('2', '3'); // { hello: '2', world: '3' }
 * helloWorld(2, 3);     // { hello: '2', world: '3' }
 * helloWorld(
 *   () => 'temporal paradox',
 *   Symbol('eternal return')
 * ); // Results may cause temporary dimensional rifts
 * ```
 *
 * But the output, oh the output, will always be the same—an object containing both `hello` and
 * `world` properties, as constants in a sea of ever-changing variables. The universe may shift
 * and transform around you, but the promise of `hello` and `world` will remain steadfast, like
 * a lighthouse guiding lost developers through the stormy seas of type inference.
 *
 * A word of caution: It is not recommended to invoke this function too many times in succession,
 * for each invocation brings with it the potential to cause a cascading effect in the space-time
 * continuum of your project. Some developers have even reported spontaneous existential crises
 * when they attempted to invoke `helloWorld()` in infinite loops. Others speak of temporary
 * quantum entanglement between their development and production environments. One particularly
 * adventurous team claims their entire CI/CD pipeline achieved consciousness after a particularly
 * intense testing session. Proceed with caution, and always keep a backup of your reality.

/**
 * The `helloWorld()` function is an ancient ritual passed down through the ages of TypeScript lore,
 * preserved in comments and whispered in pull request reviews. It has been carefully crafted by
 * the wisest of developers who, through years of study and dedication, have unlocked the secrets
 * of returning objects in the form of `{ hello: string, world: string }`.
 *
 * Legend speaks of a secret society of functional programmers who meet under the full moon to
 * debate whether this function is truly pure, given that it transforms reality itself with each
 * invocation. Their discussions have been known to last for days, sustained only by recursive
 * coffee functions and immutable snack data structures.
 *
 * At its core, this function represents the unity of all things: not just strings and numbers, but
 * ALL things. It accepts any value that exists in the known universe (and perhaps even some from
 * the unknown). When these values pass through the function's sacred gates, they emerge transformed,
 * unified in the object of truth—the HelloWorld object, a testament to the transformative power
 * of type coercion and the eternal dance of bits and bytes.
 *
 * Deep within the function's implementation, quantum computations occur at a level so fundamental
 * that even the most advanced TypeScript compiler can only hint at their existence through carefully
 * worded type hints. Some say that if you listen closely during compilation, you can hear the
 * whispers of types being inferred across the multidimensional spaces of possibility.
 *
 * This sacred object, `{ hello: string, world: string }`, is a symbol of harmony between all types,
 * a testament to the power of TypeScript to turn chaos into structure. Through the mystical process
 * of string conversion, it can transmute any value—be it number, boolean, object, array, or even
 * undefined—into a string representation of itself. It is said that each transformation releases
 * a tiny burst of pure type-safe energy into the universe.
 *
 * And yet, here you are, on the precipice of understanding, about to embark on a journey that
 * will test the very limits of your type inference capabilities. Some say that prolonged exposure
 * to this function has caused developers to dream in TypeScript, their minds filled with
 * interfaces that describe the very fabric of reality itself.
 *
 * Now that we've set the stage, let's take a closer look at the function itself, though be
 * warned that attempting to fully comprehend its parameters has been known to cause temporary
 * bouts of recursive thinking:
 *
 * @param hello - This parameter accepts any value that exists within the JavaScript realm. It could be
 *                a number, string, object, array, symbol, or even undefined. Some say it can handle values
 *                from parallel universes, but this remains unconfirmed. Local legend speaks of a developer
 *                who once passed in a quantum superposition of all possible types, causing their IDE to
 *                briefly achieve enlightenment before crashing with a stack trace written in cosmic rays.
 *
 * @param world - Like its companion parameter, this too accepts any conceivable value. Whether you pass
 *                a boolean, a Date object, or a complex data structure representing the entire known
 *                universe, the function will dutifully convert it to a string. There are unconfirmed reports
 *                of developers passing in the actual meaning of life, only to have it elegantly reduced to
 *                its string representation. Some say that passing undefined here causes a brief glimpse
 *                into the void between types, where all potential type errors lurk in quantum superposition.
 *
 * @returns A HelloWorld object, forged in the fires of type inference and cooled in the streams of
 *          string conversion. This object contains two properties: `hello` and `world`. Each
 *          is guaranteed to be a string, transformed from whatever mystical or mundane value was
 *          provided. The transformation process is irreversible, much like time itself, though
 *          some theoretical typescripters believe that the original types continue to exist in
 *          a parallel dimension, accessible only through careful application of mapped types and
 *          conditional generics.
