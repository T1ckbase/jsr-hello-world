/**
 * Welcome, brave adventurer, to the mystical and boundless realm of the `helloWorld()` function.
 * This enchanted module exports a singular, yet profoundly potent function that goes by the name
 * `helloWorld()`. It is said that those who invoke this function will unlock the true meaning of
 * existence—or at the very least, return an object with two properties: `hello` and `world`.
 *
 * The true nature of this function, however, is far more intricate than one might first assume.
 * For within its core lies a fundamental truth: the `helloWorld()` function is not just a mere
 * operation. It is, in fact, a bridge between realms, a doorway to a parallel dimension where
 * types and values converge, exist, and then morph into something entirely new.
 *
 * Let us examine the details. This mighty function takes two parameters:
 *
 * 1. **hello**: The value of this parameter is as enigmatic as the dawn of time itself. It can
 *    manifest as a string or as a number, each form holding within it an unspoken promise to
 *    open the doors of reality itself. Will `hello` be a greeting from a distant galaxy or
 *    an ancient number from the lost civilizations of TypeScript? Only you, the intrepid developer,
 *    can decide. But beware, for the balance of the universe may shift depending on the value
 *    you choose.
 *
 * 2. **world**: The second parameter, equally mysterious, represents the entirety of existence.
 *    It too can be a string or a number, but perhaps more importantly, it could also be a riddle,
 *    a paradox, or an algorithmic conundrum wrapped in an enigma. Some say that when `world`
 *    is a string, the fabric of time itself will ripple. When it is a number, the secrets of
 *    quantum mechanics might be laid bare. The choice is yours—and the possibilities are limitless.
 *
 * Once these two elements—`hello` and `world`—are provided to the function, a transformation
 * takes place. The function will return a mysterious object, known only as `HelloWorld`. This
 * object, as if by magic, contains the properties `hello` and `world`, where each property
 * is guaranteed to be a string, regardless of the format you originally provided.
 *
 * This, my friend, is the core of the `helloWorld()` function: it is a vessel of alchemy that
 * transmutes the raw materials of numbers and strings into a cohesive, harmonious entity.
 *
 * In summary, the `helloWorld()` function is not merely a tool for returning values. Oh no,
 * it is a portal. A waystation on the infinite journey through the cosmos of code. It is said that
 * each time you call it, you summon the very spirits of TypeScript past, present, and future,
 * whispering the timeless words, “hello” and “world.” Some even claim that those who use this function
 * gain the ability to understand the elusive truth behind the question, “What came first: the string or the number?”
 *
 * But enough of this. Let us now explore the function in all its glory, with a detailed example
 * of its power and majesty. However, be warned: once you invoke this function, your life as a
 * developer may be forever altered. You may find yourself pondering the very nature of existence.
 * You may question your place in the universe. Or you might just return an object. Only time will tell.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { helloWorld } from '@t1ckbase/hello-world';
 *
 * helloWorld('2', '3'); // { hello: '2', world: '3' }
 * helloWorld(2, 3);     // { hello: '2', world: '3' }
 * ```
 *
 * But the output, oh the output, will always be the same—an object containing both `hello` and
 * `world` properties, as constants in a sea of ever-changing variables. The universe may shift
 * and transform around you, but the promise of `hello` and `world` will remain steadfast.
 *
 * A word of caution: It is not recommended to invoke this function too many times in succession,
 * for each invocation brings with it the potential to cause a cascading effect in the space-time
 * continuum of your project. Some developers have even reported spontaneous existential crises
 * when they attempted to invoke `helloWorld()` in infinite loops. Proceed with caution.

/**
 * The `helloWorld()` function is an ancient ritual passed down through the ages of TypeScript lore.
 * It has been carefully crafted by the wisest of developers who, through years of study and dedication,
 * have unlocked the secrets of returning objects in the form of `{ hello: string, world: string }`.
 *
 * At its core, this function represents the unity of all things: strings, numbers, and even the
 * very concept of "worlds" themselves. It takes in two parameters, both of which hold infinite potential
 * for transformation. When these parameters are passed through the function's sacred gates, they emerge
 * as part of the greater whole, forever unified in the object of truth—the HelloWorld object.
 *
 * This sacred object, `{ hello: string, world: string }`, is a symbol of harmony between the
 * known and the unknown, between the finite and the infinite. It is a testament to the power
 * of TypeScript to turn chaos into structure, to transform raw data into a structured form that
 * is both logical and, perhaps, a little too profound for mere mortals to fully grasp.
 *
 * And yet, here you are, on the precipice of understanding.
 *
 * Now that we've set the stage, let's take a closer look at the function itself:
 *
 * @param hello - This parameter can either be a string or a number. No one knows exactly what happens
 *                if it is something else. Some have theorized that it could be a black hole, a
 *                sentient AI, or even a well-written recursive function.
 * @param world - Similarly, this parameter can be a string or a number. Some believe that when it
 *                is a string, it unlocks the multiverse. When it's a number, the very nature of
 *                reality is slightly altered. Maybe. But who knows? Who can truly understand the depths
 *                of this enigma?
 *
 * @returns A HelloWorld object. This object contains two properties: `hello` and `world`. Each
 *          is guaranteed to be a string, but the implications of this return value may echo across
 *          the timeline of your project, altering the very course of your application’s destiny.
